# Kiisseli


## Usage

- Set up your discord bot: https://www.writebots.com/discord-bot-token/

- Save your token into an .env file
```sh
$ echo 'TOKEN="token_goes.here"' > .env
```

- clone this repo

- tested with node v14.10.1, so you might want to [switch](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) if yours is different.

- install dependencies `npm i`

- edit `kiisseli.conf.js` to your preference. You will want to put your channel's ID in there, at the very least.

- run the bot `npm start`
